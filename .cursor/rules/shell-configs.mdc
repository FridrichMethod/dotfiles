# Shell configs

- Keep POSIX sh compatible logic in `sh/` packages; use bash/zsh features only in their files.
- Prefer aliases in `.zsh_aliases` / `.bash_aliases`; keep `*.rc` focused on options and sourcing.
- Place host-specific logic in host folders, guarded by OS/host checks if needed.
- For scripts in `common/zsh/.local/bin`, include a shebang and keep output quiet by default.
- Keep formatting compatible with `shfmt` and avoid shellcheck violations.
