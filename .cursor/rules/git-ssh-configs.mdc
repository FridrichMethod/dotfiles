# Git and SSH configs

- Keep shared git settings in `common/git/.gitconfig`; put machine-specific overrides in `*/git/.gitconfig_local`.
- Prefer include/includeIf blocks over duplicating settings across hosts.
- Do not commit secrets; SSH config should reference key paths only.
- Keep `.gitmodules` in sync with submodule paths and URLs.
