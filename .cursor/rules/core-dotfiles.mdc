# Dotfiles conventions

- This repo is managed with GNU Stow; keep packages as top-level folders.
- Mirror `$HOME` paths inside packages (e.g., `.config/...`, `.ssh/...`).
- Put shared defaults in `common/`; host-specific overrides live in host folders.
- Avoid absolute paths and secrets in committed configs.
- Update `stow-all.sh` and README when adding packages or changing usage.
